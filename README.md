# Revoech Training Day 1

## 👨‍🏫 Task 1: Tribute Web Page – Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam

In this task, I created a simple and responsive web page using **HTML and CSS**, dedicated to **Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam**, India's Missile Man and former President.  
The page includes:

- A header with Dr. Kalam's name and image
- A brief biography section
- Key achievements and quotes
- Clean layout using custom CSS

## 📝 Task 2: HTML Form with Multiple Functionalities

In the second task, I designed an interactive **HTML form** that collects user inputs through various form elements:

- **Text input** for name
- **Email input** for contact
- **Radio buttons** for option  selection
- **Dropdown menu** (select tag) for city or country
- **Textarea** for user message
- **Submit button** to send the form

This task demonstrates understanding of form elements, structure, and input types in HTML.
